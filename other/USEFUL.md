## Markdown

Markdown is useful if you want to create documentation for your project. Perhaps you even want to capture your own notes, recipes, todo lists, journals etc. Markdown is useful because online git repos can render it. The documentation for this project was written in markdown.

The default extension for markdown files are `.md`
