## Every dev has a favorite IDE or text editor.

### IDE (Integrated Development Editor)

IDEs are basically full-featured text editors, which allows a dev to create projects. They typically associated with a language, but with built-in (and add-on) tools to help debug, optimise, test etc. Typically they are offered in a free and a paid version.

- Intellij Idea (Java/Scala)
- Eclipse (Java/Scala)
- Visual Studio (C#)
- Xcode (Swift)
- PyCharm (Python)
- many others

### Text Editors

A text editor, is just that. Compared to IDE's they are simpler in that they can only edit text. But some editors's allows devs to import or extend the normal text editor's functionality, and therefore they can become very capable coding tools. They are typically free.
