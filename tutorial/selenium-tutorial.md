# Selenium Tutorial

Selenium is a tool/library which allows you to [automate browsers](https://www.selenium.dev/)

Because you can automate browsers, a typical use case for Selenium is to write tests with it, and automation testers use it often.

Selenium is available for [these programming languages](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/):

- Ruby
- Java
- Python
- C#
- JavaScript

## Lets compare the same Selenium Test using JavaScript and Python
