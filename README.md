# B3Labs - Basic Building Blocks Labs

This repo was designed to provide anyone with the basic building blocks to start learing programming. 

## About the name 

I am a big fan of [Lego](https://www.lego.com) blocks, and I am facinated with their `system`. Visualizing computer programs and systems as these simple building `blocks` which you can combine to create useful applications / systems, is what I aspire to teach you.
