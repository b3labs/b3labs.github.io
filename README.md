## Goal

This website (repo) was designed to provide anyone with the basic building blocks to start learing programming. 

## About the name 

I am a big fan of [Lego](https://www.lego.com) blocks, and I am facinated with their `system`. Visualizing computer programs and systems as these simple building `blocks` which you can combine to create useful applications / systems, is what I aspire to teach you.

The name is also a fun reference to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com), a popular tutorial website. This website, is designed to be a precursor to **w3schools**.

## Issues

If you have any recommendations or problems, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/b3labs/b3labs.github.io/issues)
