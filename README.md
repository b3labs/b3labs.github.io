## 1. First steps - recommended for people who are new to programming

If you don't have any programming background, it is RECOMMENDED to go through and understand the reading materials below:

1. [How a computer works](./reading/1-How-a-computer-works.md)
2. [Basic programming building blocks](./reading/2-Basic-programming-building-blocks.md)

## 2. Tutorials - A guided exercise

To complete these tutorials, just follow the steps in the tutorial.

1. [Bash - getting started](./tutorial/bash-tutorial.md)
2. [Git - getting started](./tutorial/git-tutorial.md)
3. [Git-Notes - Create your own repo to store your notes, and become more familiar with git](./tutorial/git-notes-tutorial.md)
4. [Hello World - Getting started with programming](./tutorial/hello-world.md)
5. [Selenium - automate any web browser](./tutorial/selenium-tutorial.md)
6. [Cypress - used to create automated BDD tests](./tutorial/cypress-tutorial.md)

## 3. Questions - You can submit them back to test your understanding

> IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT WORK ON MASTER, I.E. NEVER COMMIT ONTO MASTER, RATHER CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH AND WORK ON IT  
> To answer these questions, create a branch off from master with the same name as the excercise marked in **bold**. [This will show you how](./cheatsheets/git.md#Create-a-branch)  
> [After you create a new branch](./cheatsheets/git.md#Create-a-branch), you can edit the quesion's `.md` file with your answers, and commit and push it when you are done.

1. GIT (questions): create a branch called **understand-git-commands**
   - Have a look at the [git-cheatsheet](./cheatsheets/git.md)
   - _Complete the questions_ by modifying and commiting the changes in [git-questions](./questions/understand-git-commands-questions.md)
2. SBT (questions): create a branch called **understand-sbt-project-excercise**
   - Have a look at the [sbt-cheatsheet](./cheatsheets/sbt.md)
   - _Complete the questions_ by modifying and commiting the changes in [sbt-questions](./questions/understand-sbt-project-excercise.md)

## 4. Tasks - Getting your hands dirty

> IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT WORK ON MASTER, I.E. NEVER COMMIT ONTO MASTER, RATHER CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCH AND WORK ON IT  
> To answer these questions, create a branch off from master with the same name as the excercise marked in **bold**. [This will show you how](./cheatsheets/git.md#Create-a-branch)  
> [After you create a new branch](./cheatsheets/git.md#Create-a-branch), you can edit the quesion's `.md` file with your answers, and commit and push it when you are done.

1. Scalatest (task): **add-scala-tests-for-functions-excercise**
   - Create more tests for the cubed function
   - Add tests for the multiply and add functions
   - _Complete this exercise_ by modifying and commiting the file [ToTestOrNotToTestSpec.scala](../src/test/scala/ToTestOrNotToTestSpec.scala)

## 5. Cheatsheets/Quick Reference sheets

1. [git](./cheatsheets/git.md)
1. [sbt](./cheatsheets/sbt.md)

## 6. Other Things

1. [Useful](./other/USEFUL.md)
2. [Extra](./other/EXTRA.md)

## 7. About this website

- Goal
  
  This website (repo) was designed to provide anyone with the basic building blocks to start learing programming. 

- The name
  
  I am a big fan of [Lego](https://www.lego.com) blocks, and I am facinated with their **system** (a modular system which allows multiple combinations of placements). Visualizing computer programs and systems as these simple building `blocks` which you can combine to create useful applications / systems, is what I aspire to teach you.
  
  The name is also a fun reference to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com), a popular tutorial website. This website, is designed to be a precursor to **w3schools**.
